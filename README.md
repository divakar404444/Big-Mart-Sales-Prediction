# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
Our project centers on the development of a machine learning-powered sales prediction tool designed to forecast the future sales of retail products. This tool aims to provide businesses with valuable insights into their inventory management and marketing strategies by predicting the sales volume of specific items over the next 30 days.
